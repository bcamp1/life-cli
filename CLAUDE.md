I want to make a "Life Board" but in the terminal. A life board displays many boxes, one for each week in your 80 year life and shades in the boxes that you've already lived

I was born on May 22nd, 2002. The program will get the current date, calculate how many weeks I've lived, and do a CLI display of how many weeks I've lived vs not lived yet until 80*52

See example.jpg for a picture of the real Life Board.

The program shall be written in python.
